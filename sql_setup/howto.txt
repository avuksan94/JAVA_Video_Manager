Creating a user - if a user 'sa' already exists, create a user 'sas'
USE [master]
GO

CREATE LOGIN "sas"
WITH PASSWORD = N'SQL',
CHECK_POLICY = OFF,
CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF;
GO
EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember
@loginame = N'sas',
@rolename = N'sysadmin';

To be able to log in with this user, you must enable SQL Server authentication:
Open a Connection to the database -> Properties -> Security -> Select the "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" radio button
(see image sql_server_auth.png)
Possible issues -> if it doesn't allow user creation -> run as admin
Restart SQL Server
